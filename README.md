# quaint-google-charts

Google Charts plugin for Quaint

## Install

In your Quaint project directory, run the command:

    quaint --setup google-charts


## Sample usage

Simple pie chart. The first row is always the column names.

```quaint
chart pie ::
  * Gender,  People
  * Male,    497
  * Female,  503
```

Bar chart with a title and explicit size:

```quaint
chart bar ::
  height = 400
  width = 700
  title = What is your favorite programming language?
  data =
    * Language,    People,  =style
    * C,           7,       red
    * JavaScript,  10,      blue
    * Python,      13,      purple
    * Earl Grey,   1,       orange
```

Line chart with the data taken from a json file:

```quaint
chart line :: data.json
```

The same chart, but with labelled axes:

```quaint
chart line ::
  hAxis =
    title = Number of days without a zombie apocalypse
  vAxis =
    title = Dogs
  source = data.json
```

Last example. This chart is the same as found [here](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/bubblechart#color-by-numbers):

```quaint
chart bubble ::
  width = 900
  height = 500
  colorAxis =
    colors =
      * yellow
      * red
  data =
    * ID,  X,   Y, Temperature
    *   , 80, 167,         120
    *   , 79, 136,         130
    *   , 78, 184,          50
    *   , 72, 278,         230
    *   , 81, 200,         210
    *   , 72, 170,         100
    *   , 68, 477,          80
```


## `chart` macro

The `chart` macro is used to define a chart at the place it is
used. There are global attributes, and others that are specific to the
chart type you are using.

[See the documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/)
for the available chart types and options. There are many of them and
I will not list them all here.

Still, here are a few options that will work on all charts:

* **height**: Height of the chart, in pixels (default: 500).
* **width**: Width of the chart, in pixels.
* **title**: Title, displayed on top by default.
* **subtitle**: Displayed under the title
* **data**: Data points.
* **source**: File containing the data points.

Other useful options, will work when applicable:

* **hAxis**: Settings for the horizontal axis.
  * **title**: Name of the axis.
* **vAxis**: Settings for the vertical axis.
  * **title**: Name of the axis.


### `data`

The data must be a list of rows. The first row defines the column
names. The fields are comma-separated.

#### roles

If a column name starts with `=`, then the column fills a certain
*role* relative to the nearest data column to its left. For instance,
a column named `=style` defines the style of the data point on the
left. For instance, this creates a bar chart where each bar has a
different color:

```quaint
chart bar ::
  * Language,    People,  =style
  * C,           7,       red
  * JavaScript,  10,      blue
  * Python,      13,      purple
  * Earl Grey,   1,       orange
```

[Documentation on column roles](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/roles)

### `source`

Instead of `data`, the `source` attribute can be set to the path to a
file containing the data. The data can be in `json` format, or using
plugins like `quaint-csv` or `quaint-yaml`, in csv or yaml. This makes
it easy to create charts backed by data generated by a program, as
long as it is saved in a supported format.


## Options

There are no global configuration options at the moment.
